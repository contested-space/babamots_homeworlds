# Homeworlds
These are files supporting logic for John Cooper's board game "Homeworlds."
The rules support code is found in hwlogic/.
Also included are some Homeworlds analysis aids such as
* drawing the state of a game (records/analyze/drawH.py)
* presenting user's analysis of a game tree (records/analyze/explore_tree/maketree.py)

hwModeBot.py runs a Discord bot for game play and time control.
