discover b1 Jome y2 HSOJ/orig/Choosing a yellow star may give John the option to advance his b1 to an aggressive early colony or the ability to discover a large system just when Andy sets up to build a large ship. I would have preferred to discover a green star to better keep up with building blues.

John could sacrifice y2 to invade Andy's colony, but the that would cost John his only yellow, and Andy could similarly sacrifice y2 to run away. It's difficult to tell who is ahead in this position.<br><br>I like this better for Andy than getting red immediately.

    trade b1 y1 JOHS//Blocking the b3 build with a yellow trade looks less good than with a red trade because (like the actual line of play), the entrance of large yellow ships decreases John's material advantage.

    build y3 JOHS//With the blue bank so thin, it will be very difficult for Andy to get more blue ships without giving John better building opportunities. But on the other hand--with more larges on the board--John's superior medium-ship count is not so important. This might be better for John than the original line.

trade b2 r2 Jome/orig/John chooses a good time to get red. If Andy delays getting a red of his own, John's y2 can hound Andy's ships. To get his first red now, Andy will lose access to some power in in a system.
(
    trade b2 r2 JOHS/better/I prefer this move since Jome already has access to red. Later in the game, an r2 in Jome that matches a homestar will be a liability.

If John doesn't take the r2 ship out of his home, sacrificing the y3 lets Andy invade with two small reds for the catastrophe and move a green from Neverland to Narnia. Assuming no interruptions, Andy can then move g1, g3, g1 to Jome on separate turns for the winning catastrophe.<br><br>If John does move the r2, Andy only needs to move a green ship from Neverland closer to Jome to complete the machine. Andy will win if both players blindly go ahead with their Doomsday plans. Because of Andy's more complete Doomsday machine and superior mobility, I favor his position. But John has some time for counterplay, so the outcome isn't clear.
