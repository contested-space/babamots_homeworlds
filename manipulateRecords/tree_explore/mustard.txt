    move r2 Altair Alpha/better/This is better than the play in the actual game because it forces a draw (or better). However, this game was played on SDG which does not allow draws, so if the best lines are followed by both players from here, the game technically would have continued until one of them resigned. Since Beta was the challenger, it would have made sense for Beta to resign. (For games where SDG allows draws, SDG considers the challenger to be the loser in drawn games.)

Destroying four of one's own ships to get just one of one's opponent's ships is almost never a good move, but in this case, any other move allows Beta to win.
