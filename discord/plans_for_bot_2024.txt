Here are features I would like a Discord bot to have

Time conversion
    Too intrusive/hard. Discord doesn't provide a way to detect time zone, and asking for it seems annoying.
    If a user seems to have mentioned a time of day, a dynamic time-zone-adjusted timestamp reply gets posted (showing all users what time that would be in their own time zone) along with an "ephemeral" message asking if they want to keep it (bonus: adjust it)
    message objects have a datetime.datetime attribute called created_at
    Since 2022, this should be an "aware" datetime that includes the timezone
    This should be a timedelta object that is negative west of UTC:
    message.created_at.tzinfo.utcoffset()

Game moderator (like the bot I wrote circa 2020).
    Lets people play HW in a Discord channel with rulkeeping and time control

State image generation
    I think this feature is also in the game moderator bot. It would let people generate game state images in a standard way.

Looking-for-opponent role management
    Simple messages like "in" and "out" would let players join the @looking-for-opponent role.
    When someone joins, bot could ping the group and post a list of people looking
    When someone leaves, bot should probably not say much extra, either nothing or "so-and-so is no longer looking for opponent"
    Stretch goals: users can specify how long they want to stay in the group (e.g. in 3.5 to say they'll be available for the next 3.5 hours)

Emoji and sticker permission
    There is no way to limit access to specific emojis in the Discord interface, but it can be done through the API. I'd like to have an "I beat Andy" emoji or sticker that only medalists can use. I could hard-code such a thing in the bot or be fancy and create a command that only I could use to specify an emoji and the role(s) that should be able to use it
