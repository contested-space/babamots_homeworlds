homeworld g3 r1 b3 Jome/orig/John's choice to start with a blue ship is a little unusual. Most players seem to prefer starting with a green ship.

discover b1 Jome y2 HSOJ/orig/Choosing a yellow star may give John the option to advance his b1 to an aggressive early colony or the ability to discover a large system just when Andy sets up to build a large ship. I would have preferred to discover a green star to better keep up with building blues.

discover b2 Pepperland y2 Narnia/orig/If he had discovered a green system instead of yellow, Andy would be better prepared to compete for blue ships.
trade b2 r2 Jome/orig/John chooses a good time to get red. If Andy delays getting a red of his own, John's y2 can hound Andy's ships. To get his first red now, Andy will lose access to some power in in a system.<br><br>I would have preferred to get this r2 in JOHS instead since Jome already has access to red. Later in the game, an r2 in Jome that matches a homestar will be a liability.

    trade b2 r2 Narnia/better/Andy needs to use this turn to deter John's double-large invasion.
    build r3 Pepperland//John has enough material for a Doomsday machine, but it's all out of position. John's yellow supply is limited, so it will take time arrange the ships properly.

    sac g2 neverland b g2 neverland b r3 narnia//Andy has a (1r/3g) Doomsday machine <u>right now</u>. If John doesn't take the r2 ship out of his home, sacrificing the y3 lets Andy invade with two small reds for the catastrophe and move a green from Neverland to Narnia. Assuming no interruptions, Andy can then move g1, g3, g1 to Jome on separate turns for the winning catastrophe.<br><br>If John does move the r2, Andy only needs to move a green ship from Neverland closer to Jome to complete the machine. Andy will win if both players blindly go ahead with their Doomsday plans. Because of Andy's more complete Doomsday machine and superior mobility, I favor his position. But John has some time for counterplay, so the outcome isn't clear.

        sac g3 Wunderland b g3 Wunderland b r3 narnia b b2 narnia//This turn also completes Andy's Doomsday machine, but it gives John a choice to build a b3 in either in Pepperland (in Doomsday position) or in J (where it is poised to invade Neverland). Andy has little use for a b2 at this point, so giving John another b3 appears counterproductive.
