Too many options at this point. I’ll say trade for y1

Babamots — 10/13/2022 9:17 PM
Captain! Recommend we trade g1 for r1 in our home system!

Amnykon — 10/13/2022 10:35 PM
@forkofnature I recommend building a g1

Babamots — 10/14/2022 12:00 AM
@Crit1Calends Captain! We should build r1 at the homeworlds!

Amnykon — 10/14/2022 6:10 AM
@forkofnature I suggest you get another y1

Babamots — 10/14/2022 6:21 AM
@Crit1Calends Captain! I recommend building a g2 at the homeworld!

Amnykon — 10/14/2022 7:20 AM
@forkofnature I would still recommend building a y1

Babamots — 10/14/2022 5:11 PM
@Crit1Calends Oh captain! I recommend discovering a y3 star with our g2 ship!

Amnykon — 10/14/2022 9:04 PM
@forkofnature moving g2 to a y3 would allow you to keep building those greens.

Babamots — 10/15/2022 12:21 AM
@Crit1Calends My captain! Recommend building r1 in the homeworld.

Amnykon — 10/15/2022 12:37 PM
@forkofnature I agree. Keep it peaceful, and move your g1 to a b3.

Babamots — 10/15/2022 12:55 PM
@Crit1Calends Captain! The Alti colony needs more broccoli! We should build a g2 there.

Amnykon — 10/15/2022 2:18 PM
Yes that is what I meant. Trade a g1 for a r1.

Babamots — 10/15/2022 5:00 PM
@Crit1Calends Captain! We're falling behind in banana power! We should trade g1 for y1 in Alti.

Amnykon — 10/15/2022 5:24 PM
@forkofnature captain, we should swarm him with bananas. Sacrifice our g3 for 2 y3 in our hw, and a y1 in bleb.

Babamots — 10/15/2022 10:13 PM
@Crit1Calends Captain! There's too many bananas! I don't know how long they'll hold! I recommend we move y2 from the homeworld to Alti.

Amnykon — 10/16/2022 8:49 AM
@forkofnature if bananas are so radioactive, build him some in his HW. (Sac g3 to build y1,y2 in his hw, and a y3 in ours.)

Babamots — 10/16/2022 2:58 PM
@Crit1Calends Captain! The bananas are a loss! The best we can do is make sure they don't get any bigger. discover r1 Home y3

Amnykon — 10/16/2022 3:47 PM
@forkofnature you have many options; however, the simplest is to give them the banana at Bleb, giving their HW 4 bananas.

Babamots — 10/16/2022 6:42 PM
@Crit1Calends Having lost the banana race, I recommend we try... radishes! build r1 Home

Amnykon — 10/16/2022 7:28 PM
@forkofnature capture, he is giving you a large strawberry. Capture it with your g3 while you can.

Babamots — 10/16/2022 7:54 PM
@Crit1Calends Captain! They rejected our large strawberry, so we should commandeer their broccoli! capture g3 Home fork

Amnykon — 10/16/2022 8:18 PM
@forkofnature victory is ours. Take the rose! (It’s a double move, I can’t prevent it anyway)

Babamots — 10/16/2022 9:33 PM
@Crit1Calends Captain! I recommend we build g1 in Dioj!

Amnykon — 10/16/2022 9:59 PM
@forkofnature we need more bananas. Build another one in our HW.

Babamots — 10/16/2022 11:12 PM
@Crit1Calends Captain! I suggest sacrificing our r2 at home to capture both y1 invaders at home!

Amnykon — 10/17/2022 8:59 AM
Trade a large banana for a large cherry, we will have a good ice cream Sunday… who put the broccoli in my ice cream!?!

Babamots — 10/17/2022 6:07 PM
@Crit1Calends Captain! We need to strike at their star at once! Arm the blueberry torpedoes! trade g1 b1 homeworld fork

Amnykon — 10/18/2022 5:40 PM
@forkofnature if it going to be green, make it green. Trade a large banana in our HW for broccoli.

Babamots — 10/19/2022 12:13 AM
@Crit1Calends Captain! We need more Brussels sprouts back at home! build g2 Home Crit

Amnykon — 10/19/2022 5:28 PM
@forkofnature blueberries Blueberries steal their blueberries.

Babamots — 10/19/2022 11:47 PM
@Crit1Calends Captain! I suggest we prepare more broccoli! trade r2 g2 Home

Amnykon — 10/20/2022 6:57 PM
You should still steal the blueberries.

Babamots — 10/20/2022 10:49 PM
@Crit1Calends Captain! I recommend we commandeer some broccoli! sacrifice r1 Home Crit capture g1 Home fork

Amnykon — 10/21/2022 9:19 AM
@forkofnature Since you don't want his blueberries or raspberries, take his broccoli.
